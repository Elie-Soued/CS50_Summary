        <h3>What is Computer Science?</h3>

        <p>
          Computer science is the study of information and how we use
          information to solve problems.
          <br />
          The term "computer science" can be misleading because humans have been
          using information to solve problems throughout history, long before
          computers existed. <br />

          Each era had its own information technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          In our area, the technology that is at the core of modern computing is
          the transistor.<br />
          A transistor is a piece of hardware that controls electrical current
          by switching it on and off.<br />
          Computers interpret an "on" state as 1 and an "off" state as 0. <br />
          0 and 1 are called bits or Binary digIT.
        </p>

        <p>
          We decided to represent information by using 8 of these bits also
          known as 1 byte.<br />
          Based on the context, these bytes can represent numbers, letters,
          colors and sound.<br />
          If natural Languages allows us to communicate with other humans,
          programming languages allows us to manipulates bytes and to
          communicate with machines.<br />
