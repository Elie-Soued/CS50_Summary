        <h3>My take aways from CS50</h3>
        <p>
          Taking CS50 was one of the best decisions of this year. <br />
          I really learned a lot and recommend it to anyone who wants to pursue
          a career in computer science. <br />
          Initially, I started summarizing what I learned to better organize and
          digest the information I was absorbing. <br />
          For each of the 10 weeks, I plan to share either a topic I learned in
          the course or a topic the course inspired me to explore further (such
          as during the Python section). <br />
          I hope you will find this article informative and insightful. <br />
