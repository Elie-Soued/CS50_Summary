        <h3>Dynamic Memory Allocation : Pointers to the rescue</h3>

        <p>
          C introduces data types (int, float, double, long, and char) that have
          specific sizes in memory.<br />
          If I want to represent the number 47, I typically use an int, which
          takes 4 bytes in my computer's memory—equivalent to 32 bits.<br />

          But what if you want the user to input their name? How many char
          values would you need?<br />
          The answer is: we don’t know, because names vary in length.<br />

          <h5>Strings</h5>

          This brings us to our first challenge with dynamic data.<br />
          Strings are inherently dynamic, so we needed a strategy to represent
          them efficiently in memory.<br />

          To solve this, it was decided to terminate strings with a NUL (\0)
          character. This allowed us to determine where a string ends.<br />

          Alright, but how do we determine where a string starts?<br />
          For that, we use pointers, which store memory addresses of
          variables.<br />

          So, to represent a string, we typically store a memory address
          (indicating where the string starts) and end it with a NUL character
          (\0).<br />
        </p>

        <h5>Arrays</h5>

        <p>
          Our second challenge with dynamic data relates to arrays.<br />
          In C, arrays are not dynamic.<br />

          If we want to add a new element to an array, we need to allocate new
          memory, copy all the existing elements into it, and then add the new
          value.<br />
          This process is inefficient, especially for large arrays.<br />

          Once again, pointers come to the rescue.<br />
          To solve the issue of array dynamism, we use pointers to create linked
          lists.<br />

          A linked list is a collection of nodes, where each node contains a
          value and a pointer to the next node.<br />
          This approach allows us to dynamically add elements to the list
          without needing to find a contiguous block of memory, unlike arrays
          which must be allocated as a single, continuous chunk.
