        <h3>Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation</h3>
        <p>
          C introduces data types that have specific sizes in memory (<code
            >int</code
          >
          , <code>float</code>, <code>long</code> and <code>char</code> ) . If I
          want to represent the number 47, I typically use an <code>int</code>,
          which takes 4 bytes in my computer's memory—equivalent to 32 bits. But
          what if you want the user to input their name? How many
          <code>char</code> would you need? The answer is: we don’t know,
          because names vary in length.
        </p>

        <h5>Strings</h5>
        <p>
          Strings are inherently dynamic, so we needed a strategy to represent
          them efficiently in memory. To solve this, it was decided to terminate
          strings with a NUL <code> \0</code> character. This allowed us to
          determine where a string ends. Alright, but how do we determine where
          a string starts? For that, we use pointers, which store memory
          addresses of variables. So to represent a string, we typically store a
          memory address (indicating where the string starts) and end it with a
          NUL character <code>\0</code>.
        </p>

        <h5>Arrays</h5>
        <p>
          Our second challenge with dynamic data relates to arrays. In C, arrays
          are not dynamic. If we want to add a new element to an array, we need
          to allocate new memory, copy all the existing elements into it, and
          then add the new value. This process is inefficient, especially for
          large arrays. Once again, pointers come to the rescue. To solve the
          issue of array dynamism, we use pointers to create linked lists. A
          linked list is a collection of nodes, where each node contains a value
          and a pointer to the next node. This approach allows us to dynamically
          add elements to the list without needing to find a contiguous block of
          memory, unlike arrays which must be allocated as a single, continuous
          chunk.

        Alright, so we looked at arrays and linked lists. What other
        <a href="/data_structure.html">data structures</a> are there?
