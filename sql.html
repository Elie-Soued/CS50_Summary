        <h3>What is SQL?</h3>
  

      <p>
        SQL or structured query language is declarative language used for
        relational databases.<br />
        It is important to note that everything that is done in SQL could be
        done in other languages.<br />
        SQL has been designed to manipulate data more easily.<br />
        One SQL line can replace many lines of python.<br />
        Here also, we will not spend time on the syntax but rather on some
        interesting concepts that we covered in the course.<br />


        <h5>CRUD</h5>
        The main actions that we make on a database are :<br />
        C: Create / INSERT <br />
        R: Read / SELECT<br />
        U: Update / ALTER<br />
        D: Delete / DROP
      </p>
      <p>
        
        <h5>Primary key, foreign key and join tables</h5>

A primary key is a unique identifier that represents a row in a table.<br>
A Foreign Key is a key that represent a primary key of a different table.<br>

Let's take an example to better understand the relationship between primary and foreign key:<br>
1-Table Company contains the following fields : Company Name, Product, Location and Company ID (Company ID is the primary key that will be used in a different table)<br>
2-Table Employee contains the following fields : Employee Name, Employee position, Company ID ( Company ID is a foreign key that reference the company in the company table)<br>
This is how combine information with SQL<br>

In the case of many to many relations, we need to create a join table to connect the 2 tables.<br>
Let's take a look at an example here as well:<br>
<br>

1-Field of Student Table : name,  major, id (primary key)<br>
2-Field of Courses Table :  subject,  duration, id (primary key)<br>
If you want to know the names of all the student that took a specific course, will need to create a third table (join table):<br>
3- student_course (join table) fields : student_id (foreign key) , course_id ( foreign key)<br>
And then join the 2 tables on this table like this:<br>
SELECT name FROM Student JOIN student_course ON Student.id = student_course.student_id  JOIN Courses ON Courses.id = student_course.course_id  WHERE Courses.subject = 'Computer Science';<br>
      </p>

      <table class="table table-striped">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Relationship</th>
            <th>Example</th>
            <th>Schema</th>
            <th>Foreign key placement</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>One to One (1:1)</td>
            <td>Person → Passport</td>
            <td>passports.person_id UNIQUE </td>
            <td>Foreign key in one table, set as unique.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>One-to-Many (1:M)</td>
            <td>Company → Employees</td>
            <td>employees.company_id </td>
            <td>Foreign key in the child table (employees).</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Many-to-Many (M:M)</td>
            <td>Students ↔ Courses</td>
            <td>enrollments(student_id, course_id)</td>
            <td>| Join table with two foreign keys. </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

<h5>Indexes, Race conditions and SQL injections attacks</h5> 

<br>
<b>Indexes</b><br>
create a B-tree structure (not binary tree structure) that allows us to access information faster.<br>
improves performance a lot when we want to read data from the database but might slow down the insertion and deletion ( as we saw with tree like structure<br>
That need to stay balanced). So they are great for read heavy sites.<br>
<br>
<b>Race conditions</b>
<br>
Imagine a picture goes viral and everyone in the world wants to like it at the same time.<br>
How can we make sure we can hanlde the database update in a way that data is not lost?<br>
So there are many techniques to handle this problem but we will focus on one in particular which is transcations and pessimistic locking.<br>
In our example, the transaction will group the reading and the updating of the likes in one operation and the locking will make sure that one transaction is executed at a time.<br>
For more on the topic look ACID properties in database<br>
<br>
<b>SQL Injection Attacks</b><br>
SQL Injection Attacks are malicious inputs that could give access to unauthorized information.<br>
If your API is using f format and not placeholders, I use could enter as username : name'-- <br>
The ' would close the first string and the -- would ignore everything after this command.<br>
So basically I user could access the account of someone by only entering the username and not the password.<br>
So use the placeholder instead of the f string.<br>
rows = db.execute (f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'") // Bad<br>
rows = db.execute ("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ? ", username , password)  // Better<br>

        Python and SQL are languages that are also used a lot in Web programming.<br>
        In the 90s the world wide web as we know it was created.<br>
        Do you know how the <a href="/htmlcssjs.html">world wide web</a> works?
