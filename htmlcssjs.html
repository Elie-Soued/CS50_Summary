        <h3>What is the Internet?</h3>
        <p>
          The internet is a global network of interconnected devices that share
          information. <br />
          The protocol suite used to share information is called TCP/IP. <br />
          Just like "computer science" is a misleading name, TCP/IP is also
          somewhat misleading because TCP and IP are not the only protocols used
          in the TCP/IP protocol suite (though they are the most fundamental and
          well-known).<br />
          The TCP/IP protocol suite can be conceptualized as a five-layer
          model:<br />

          -Application layer<br />
          -Transport layer<br />
          -Network layer<br />
          -Data link layer<br />
          -Physical layer<br />

          Let's look at each of these layers to understand how information is
          shared over the internet:<br />
          <br />
          <b>Application layer</b><br />
          3 things happen on the application layer:<br />
          1- The application produces binary data<br />
          2- The protocol we use to send the information is chosen. It could be
          HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP or SSH.<br />
          3- DNS lookup is done to resolve the IP address of the destination
          server.<br />

          <br />
          <b>Transport layer</b><br />
          The binary data from the application layer is broken down into small
          chuncks called segments.<br />
          A header is added to each segments containing:<br />
          1- The destination port to identify the service we want to access ( by
          convention port 443 is for HTTPS request and port 25 is for emails)<br />
          2- The source port to allow multiplexing (meaning many people can send
          simultaneous requests from the same network)<br />
          3- The sequence number of the segment to be able to assemble it upon
          reception.<br />

          The protocol that defines how these segments are created is called
          TCP.(There is another protocol that could be used at this layer called
          UDP, but this is outside of the scope of this course).<br />
          At this layer we establish a TCP connection between the source and the
          destination server.<br />
          The protocol defined on the application works on top of the TCP
          connection.<br />
          <br />
          <b>Network layer</b><br />
          We add to the segments an additional header containing the IP source
          and destination. Making the segment packets.<br />
          By containing the IP information, the packets can be correctly routed
          to the destination server.<br />
          The Routers are servers that will inspect the packets, check the IP
          and route the packet closer to the their destination.<br />
          <br />
          <b>Data link layer</b><br />
          This layer is responsible of getting the Mac address of the
          destination server.<br />
          So once the data reaches the destination network, it uses 2 protocols
          (ARP and Ethernet) to get the MAC address.<br />
          The MAC address is added to the packets making it a Frame.<br />
          At this point the data is ready to be sent.<br />
          The 4 steps that prepare the data to be sent is what we call :
          encapsulation.<br />
          Once the data reaches the destination server the same steps are done
          in the opposite direction (decapsulation)<br />
          <br />
          <b>Physical layer</b><br />
          When sending information, the binary data is transformed into
          electrical current and sent through the network.<br />
          When receiving information, the electrical current is transformed to
          binary data and sent back up to the application level passing by all
          the other layers in the opposite direction.<br />
          The most important step in decapsulation happens at the transport
          layer, where the data is reassembled (thanks to the sequence number in
          the TCP header) and sent back to the application layer.<br />
