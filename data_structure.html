        <h3>What are Data structures?</h3>
        <p>
          We tend to study data structures and algorithms together because they
          are – as you can imagine – related.<br />
          Data structures allow us to
          <i>represent, store and access data </i> whereas algorithms allow us
          to <i>manipulate</i> this data.<br />
          But before diving into the relationship between data structures and
          algorithms, let's start with some definitions:<br />
        </p>

        A <b>Data structure</b> is a way to organize data in a computer memory
        to enable efficient access and modification.<br />
        It defines the relationship between the data and the operations that
        could be performed on the data.<br />

        <b>Abstract data type</b> is an abstracted data structure than can be
        implemented in different ways.<br />
        A <i>dictionnary</i> is the idea that I want to assign a value to a
        key.<br />
        I can implement it with a "concrete" data structure like a hashmap.<br />
        <br />

        <h4>Algorithm vs Function</h4>

        <h6>What is difference between a function and an algorithm?</h6>

        An algorithm is an abstracted series of instructions designed to
        fulfilled a specific goal.<br />
        A function is a "concrete" series of instruction designed to fulfill a
        specific goal. Typically written using a programming language.<br />
        We need data structures and functions to implement an algorithm.<br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Algorithm Running time</h4>

        To evaluate an algorithm, we typically look at the best and worst case
        scenario.<br />
        How many operation does my alogrithm execute in the worst case?<br />
        How many operations does it execute in the best case?<br />
        We use the Big O notation to express the worst case scenario. O stands
        for order.<br />
        And we use Omega (Ω) to represent the best case scenario.<br />
        In case an algorithm behaves the same in the best and in the worst case,
        we say that this algorithm is in theta complexity.<br />
        Array indexing will always take a constant time to execute. Therefore we
        can say that array indexing is in theta of 1.

      <p>
        Since an algorithm is a serie of abstracted instructions, we can
        implement the same algorithm in different languages. <br />
